Run the interface such as 'python src/interface.py'.

Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the interface. Option 1 will allow you to run the complete pipeline, although this make take an extended period of time and a fair amount of resource consumption. However, this will give you custom models to compare with our own, or play around with yourself. Option 2 will allow you to interat with our saved models and test it on custom data or live data from Twitter. Please note any attempts to pull live data must be made on public accounts, as private accounts are not able to be interacted with through the Twitter API. 

For all other files, please also run from root using 'python src/filenamehere.py'.
